	Vivek Singh Memorial Trust, instituted in the year 2010, is founded and run by a
	group of students of the 2005-2009 batch of <a href="http://www.nitdgp.ac.in">National Institute of Technology(NIT)
	Durgapur</a> in the memory of their beloved friend <b>Late Vivek Singh</b> who passed
	away in a tragic accident on 29.03.2009.
	<br>
	<br>
	The trust is aimed at honouring Vivek's spirit of helping others and at making an
	effort for the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society through moral as
	well as financial support. The trust is based out of Delhi and was started with
	the main aim of funding a scholarship programme at NIT Durgapur under the title
	of <b>"Vivek Singh Memorial Scholarship"</b>. However, with the loyal
	and ever-increasing support of its contributors, the trust has also ventured and
	taken-up similar cause in other spheres. Further, the trust plans to extend its
	role in giving-back to the society and do its bit in reforming the society.
