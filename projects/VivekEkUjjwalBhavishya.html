					<b>Project Head :</b> Mr. Nimit Goenka 
					(<i>nimit.goenka@vsmemorialtrust.org</i>) 
					<br><br>This initiative is under the flagship program    
					<b><i>Vivek - Ek Ujjwal Bhavishya</i></b> and has been incubated with ideas and    suggestions from 
					 <i>Mr. Vignesh Prabhu and Mr. Dipesh Kumar Kalyani</i>, batch     2009 alumni of NIT    Durgapur. 
					 The initiative entails     the responsibility of raising the level of  education     by providing education to 
					 children who due to economic     reasons are unable  to avail      it. The initiative aims    at taking responsibility
					  of children by a group of committed          ,sincere and hardworking individuals. The Trust hopes that this  
					  initiative will be a stepping stone that will help our nation to attain its    vision of Total Literacy.<br><br> 
					  The details     of the  initiative are as follows:      <ol><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Number of children:</b><br> The number    of children depends upon the number of
							 committed volunteers who are able   to devote their time for the same.<br>  
							 We are presently supporting 19 children. <b><a class="projectMoreDetails1" id="vsUjwalMoreDetails" href="#vsUjwalMoreDetails">VIEW DETAILS</a></b></li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Average Expense per child</b><br>   An    average expense of around 
				 INR 7,000 per year per              child is  to be incurred. The expense will                           
				  be borne by the Trust.     </li><li><b>Volunteers</b><br>   This initiative's succes   is vested mainly 
				  on the  willingness of some members to    commit    themselves towards this task. So, the volunteers form an
				   essential part. The essential  tasks they are required to perform are:  <ol type="a"><li>Get the    child admitted in the school and know  about his/her background because bonding  is the essence 
				   of this initiative.</li><li>A periodic surveillance (monthly) to monitor the child's progress and to  
					 attend to    his/her problems and updating a report about the   child to the Trust.</li><li>He/She should also look forward to having a meeting (preferably during  admission) 
					  and sort out matters like payment of fees, books, miscellaneous  expenses.</li><li>Most importantly, since the volunteer is responsible  for the child, so in case if   he/she   
				 happens to be ill or is moving  away from the city (for future studies, job change etc), i.e 
				 if he/she is not able to attend to the child, then a successor should be found    who can take over the 
				 responsibility along with the updation in the forum.</li></ol></li></ol><br>  
				 Here are  some specification which has been    unanimously agreed:         <ol><li>Instead of individual responsibility, we will form groups of such volunteers so       
				   that the responsibility is divided and involvement is  multiplied.</li><li>We are committed to support each child minimum  upto class 5th, 8th, 10th, 12th or graduation level,
					whichever is possible. </li><li>The Trust will support only  2 children from 1 family and will ensure fair    
					overall gender ratio.</li></ol></div>
